**Butter: Scripting Language Engine**<br>
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Butter/1.1.0
<br>
Create scripting languages easily with Butter!
Butter is designed to handle the hardest part of making your own scripting language: the *syntax*.
<br>
<br>
***Project:butter*** - The Butter library<br>
***Project:test*** - The test code backend library<br>
***Project:TestForm*** - The test host to use Butter & the backend<br>
<br>
<br>
Currently only for .NET Framework 4.8, anyone who uses Butter will have to downgrade it to other versions for use.
